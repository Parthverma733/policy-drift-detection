RURAL HEALTHCARE ACCESS POLICY

Policy Title: Comprehensive Rural Healthcare Initiative (CRHI)

MISSION STATEMENT:
This policy aims to provide comprehensive healthcare services to all rural districts, with special emphasis on districts with healthcare access rates below 60%. The program requires consistent quarterly reporting and mandates minimum service coverage of 75% of the target population.

TARGET POPULATIONS:
1. Rural districts with healthcare access rate below 60%
2. Remote areas with population density less than 100 per square kilometer
3. Districts with infant mortality rate above 50 per 1000 births
4. Communities with scheduled tribes and scheduled castes
5. Below poverty line households in rural regions

QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum service coverage: 75% of eligible population must receive services
- Maximum quarterly variance: 15% variation between quarters is acceptable
- Resource utilization: At least 85% of allocated healthcare resources must be utilized
- Reporting frequency: Quarterly reports are mandatory
- Consistency requirement: Service delivery must maintain consistency across all quarters

TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Quarterly reporting is mandatory
- Reports must be submitted within 10 days of quarter end
- Service delivery must be continuous without gaps exceeding 30 days

RESOURCE ALLOCATION GUIDELINES:
- Healthcare resources must be distributed equitably
- Priority allocation to districts with access rate < 60%
- No district should receive zero resource allocation
- Allocation should be proportional to population and need

MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
- Quarterly review of service coverage metrics
- Annual assessment of resource utilization
- Immediate action required for districts with coverage below 75%
- Variance monitoring to ensure consistency

IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS:
All implementing agencies must ensure:
1. Service coverage does not drop below 75% threshold
2. Quarterly variance remains within 15% limit
3. Resource utilization meets 85% minimum requirement
4. Regular quarterly reporting without gaps
