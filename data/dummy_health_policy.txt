NATIONAL HEALTH COVERAGE POLICY

Policy Title: Universal Health Access Initiative (UHAI)

OBJECTIVE:
This comprehensive policy aims to ensure universal access to quality healthcare services across all districts, with special emphasis on districts with literacy rates below 60%, remote areas, and underserved populations. The program mandates minimum health coverage of 80% for priority districts and 85% for standard districts, with consistent monthly monitoring.

TARGET GROUPS:
1. Districts with literacy rate below 60%
2. Remote and tribal health zones
3. Urban slum areas with health access below 70%
4. Economically disadvantaged populations
5. Districts with high infant mortality rates
6. Areas with limited healthcare infrastructure

QUANTITATIVE CONSTRAINTS:
- Minimum health coverage: 80% for priority districts, 85% for standard districts
- Maximum monthly variance: 12% month-over-month change allowed
- Resource utilization: Minimum 75% of allocated health funds must be utilized for priority districts, 80% for standard districts
- Quality threshold: Health service quality index must be at least 60
- Consistency period: Monthly monitoring and reporting required

TEMPORAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Monthly reporting is mandatory
- Reports must be submitted within 7 days of month end
- Continuous monitoring without gaps exceeding 15 days
- Quarterly assessment of fund utilization
- Annual comprehensive evaluation required

RESOURCE ALLOCATION RULES:
- Health funds must be distributed based on population needs and vulnerability
- Priority allocation to districts with literacy rate < 60%
- No health zone should receive zero allocation
- Allocation must be proportional to population and health indicators
- Special allocation for primary healthcare centers in remote areas

MONITORING AND EVALUATION:
- Monthly review of coverage and access metrics
- Quarterly assessment of fund utilization rates
- Annual evaluation of health quality indices
- Immediate intervention required for districts with coverage below thresholds
- Variance monitoring to detect implementation inconsistencies

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
All health departments must ensure:
1. Coverage does not drop below 80% threshold for priority districts
2. Monthly variance remains within 12% limit
3. Fund utilization meets minimum requirements
4. Regular monthly reporting without gaps
5. Quality standards are maintained across all districts
