NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY

Policy Title: Comprehensive Agriculture Support Program (CASP)

OBJECTIVE:
This policy aims to enhance agricultural productivity and support farmers across all districts, with special focus on districts with literacy rates below 65%, dry land regions, and subsistence farming communities. The program mandates minimum coverage of 70% for priority districts and 75% for standard districts, with consistent monitoring of agricultural support services.

TARGET GROUPS:
1. Districts with literacy rate below 65%
2. Dry land and rain-fed agriculture regions
3. Subsistence farming communities
4. Tribal and indigenous farming areas
5. Small and marginal farmers
6. Districts with low agricultural productivity

QUANTITATIVE CONSTRAINTS:
- Minimum coverage: 70% for priority districts, 75% for standard districts
- Maximum monthly variance: 20% month-over-month change allowed
- Resource utilization: Minimum 60% of allocated agriculture funds must be utilized for priority districts, 65% for standard districts
- Productivity threshold: Agricultural productivity index must be at least 50
- Consistency period: Monthly monitoring required

TEMPORAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Monthly reporting is mandatory
- Reports must be submitted within 10 days of month end
- Seasonal variations must be accounted for in variance calculations
- Quarterly assessment of fund utilization
- Annual comprehensive evaluation of agricultural outcomes

RESOURCE ALLOCATION RULES:
- Agriculture funds must be distributed based on farmer population and agricultural area
- Priority allocation to districts with literacy rate < 65%
- Allocation proportional to agricultural land and farmer density
- Special allocation for irrigation projects in dry regions
- Support for organic farming initiatives

MONITORING AND EVALUATION:
- Monthly review of coverage and support metrics
- Quarterly assessment of fund utilization
- Annual evaluation of agricultural productivity indices
- Immediate intervention for districts with coverage below thresholds
- Variance monitoring accounting for seasonal patterns

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
All agriculture departments must ensure:
1. Coverage does not drop below 70% threshold for priority districts
2. Monthly variance remains within 20% limit (accounting for seasonality)
3. Fund utilization meets minimum requirements
4. Regular monthly reporting without gaps
5. Support services reach all eligible farmers
